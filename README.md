# Midscript (working title)

## TODOs

### Syntax

1.  Requiring commas after every attribute is error-prone
2.  Requiring you to quote strings also sucks

### Internals

1.  Too many grab-bag things done in validation - validate as early as possible
2.  We shouldn't generate code from the parse-tree directly
3.  Or alternatively - the parse tree should be a cleaner, stronger model of a fully _correct_ piece
