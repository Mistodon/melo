# Midscript (working title)

## TODOs

### Syntax

1.  Requiring commas after every attribute is error-prone - take newlines into account
2.  Requiring you to quote strings also sucks

### Errors

1.  Sequencing and generation phases need proper errors

### Features

1.  Urgently need note lengths supported
2.  Voice volume would be useful

### Bugs

1.  Generation crashes when a voice contains no bars/notes.
2.  Notes in tuplets are not split up properly
